# Youtube Uploads To Playlist
## Automatically add all channel uploads to selected playlist

Youtube to this day has problems with playing videos from one channel one after the other.
The major problem with autoplay is that often it jumps to other channel or unrelated video.
This tool was mode for people who want to watch (or listen to) all videos from one channel continuesly, by automatically adding them to a user playlist.
It seems simple but that operation requires nearly 500 lines of JavaScript thanks to Youtube API limitations.

### Notice
Due to quota cost of playlist write operations and ratelimitting web app can freeze or reject login attempts.
